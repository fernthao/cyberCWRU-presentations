### What is a VPN?
<!-- .slide: data-background="./../backgrounds/image3.svg" -->
- Thing that 
    - fake your computer's address so sites that block your actual address now allow acess
    - sites who track you won't know who you really are
    - let you access Case's network when you are off campus

### What is a VPN?
<!-- .slide: data-background="./../backgrounds/image4.svg" -->
- A virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network that uses network virtualization to extend a private network across a public network, such as the Internet, via the use of encryption and tunneling protocols. In a VPN, a tunneling protocol is used to transfer network messages from one network host to another. - Wikipedia

### Network
<!-- .slide: data-background="./../backgrounds/image2.svg" -->
- **Connected** computers that can talk to each other

- Blue links? Magic ✨
  - hardware - bits on the wires or RF (wifi)
  - software - figure out which bits go to which computer, and which process on that computer
- Internet = network of networks

### OSI Model
<!-- .slide: data-background="./../backgrounds/image3.svg" -->
- A framework to understand computer networks

- encapsulation
  - packet (piece of data) 
    - header: shipping label
    - data: content
  - packets get wrapped inside another packet before sending on the wire
  - unwrapped upon receiving

---

### Protocol
<!-- .slide: data-background="./../backgrounds/image4.svg" -->
- Protocol:
  - Agreed upon set of rules between 2 computers that want to talk to each other
  - Eg: HTTP protocol
- Each layer in OSI model has an associated set of protocol

### Tunneling
<!-- .slide: data-background="./../backgrounds/image2.svg" -->
- Encrypted data moving between network
- Use encapsulation 
  - allow private communications to be sent across a public network
  - one network protocol to be carried over an incompatible network 
- Tunneling protocols: PPTP (insecure), IPSec, WireGuard, OpenVPN
- Overlay network:
  - use tunneling 
  - virtual overlay network on top of a physical underlay network

### VPN
- VPN - Virtual Private Network
  - an overlay network
  - use tunneling to achieve secure communication over an untrusted underlay (public Internet)
- IPSec - encrypt original IP packet, encapsulate it inside new IP packet
  - ![IPSec](https://cdn.networklessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ipsec-esp-tunnel-mode-traditional.svg)

### Myth #1 - privacy
- instead of your traffic going straight from your device to a website, it is routed through a remote server that encrypts the connection and masks your IP address. 
  - do you trust that remote server?

### Myth #2 - security
- VPN encrypts your traffic
- so does HTTPS - default in most popular browser
- attacks come from phishing and stolen credentials > hacking the tunnel
-> companies are moving to zero-trust instead of relying on VPN

### Can a VPN still be useful?
- Routing through server in countries with more desirable privacy & security laws
- Trusted providers
- Private virtual network between your own devices -> stable IP

### Demo
- Tailscale
  - peer-to-peer VPN
  - use WireGuard

### Peer to peer VPN
- Devices:
  - laptop
  - lampi

- Each device:
  - Generates a cryptographic key pair.
  - Registers public key with Tailscale’s coordination server.
  - Gets assigned a stable private IP address (e.g. 100.x.x.x) -> stable across networks, mapped to registered key

### Traffic flow
- Laptop looks up lampi's public key + latest endpoint from control server.
- Attempts direct encrypted tunnel using WireGuard.
- Falls back to relay (DERP) if p2p fails

### 5 mins to get your stable IP
- On lamp and laptop:
  - `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`
  - `sudo tailscale up`
- On lamp:
`tailscale ip`
