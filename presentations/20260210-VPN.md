### What is a VPN?
- Thing that 
    - fake your computer's address so sites that block your actual address now allow acess
    - sites who track you won't know who you really are
    - let you access Case's network when you are off campus

### What is a VPN?
- A virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network that uses network virtualization to extend a private network across a public network, such as the Internet, via the use of encryption and tunneling protocols. In a VPN, a tunneling protocol is used to transfer network messages from one network host to another. - Wikipedia

### Network
- **Connected** computers that can talk to each other
![Network](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-MBB5HA53rrs%2FTVllpGkBh3I%2FAAAAAAAAAQs%2FNRCAVIRKFQA%2Fs1600%2F125375768818_network.jpg)
- Blue stuff? Magic ✨
      - hardware - bits on the wires or RF (wifi)
      - software - figure out which bits go to which computer, and which process on that computer
- Internet = network of networks

### OSI Model
- A framework to understand computer networks
- ![OSI-model](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fd33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net%2F1f264856eb80b2505424ff58521557eab1c10e6b%2F334a1%2Fimages%2Fosi.jpg)
- encapsulation
  - packet (piece of data) 
    - header: shipping label
    - data: content
  - packets get wrapped inside another packet before sending on the wire
  - unwrapped upon receiving

---

### Protocol
- Protocol:
  - Agreed upon set of rules between 2 computers that want to talk to each other
  - Eg: HTTP protocol
- Each layer in OSI model has an associated set of protocol

---
### Tunneling
- Encrypted data moving between hosts 
- Tunneling protocols: PPTP (insecure), IPSec, WireGuard, OpenVPN
- Overlay network:
  - use tunneling 
  - virtual overlay network on top of a physical underlay network

### VPN
- VPN - Virtual Private Network
  - an overlay network
  - secure tunnel over an untrusted underlay (public Internet)
- IPSec - encrypt original IP packet, encapsulate it inside new IP packet

### Myth #1 - privacy
- instead of your traffic going straight from your device to a website, it is routed through a remote server that encrypts the connection and masks your IP address. 
  - do you trust that remote server?

### Myth #2 - security
- VPN encrypts your traffic
- so does HTTPS - default in most popular browser
- attacks come from phishing and stolen credentials > hacking the tunnel
-> companies' move to zero trust instead of replying on VPN
